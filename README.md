Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)
Problem Description
This project aims to identify subgroups in a breast cancer dataset using unsupervised learning. By clustering patients based on tumor features, the analysis helps uncover hidden patterns, potentially distinguishing high-risk and low-risk groups. This can aid in diagnosis, treatment planning, and early detection of breast cancer.
The notebook uses unsupervised learning, specifically the K-Means clustering algorithm, to group patients into clusters. It applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction to visualize the data and the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters. The clustering performance is evaluated using the silhouette score.
Dataset used: The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset
